# A Saliency-Guided Street View Image Inpainting Framework for Efficient Last-Meters Wayfinding [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06934.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com">Paper</a>]

We propose a saliency-guided street view image inpainting method, which can remove distracting objects to redirect human visual attention to static landmarks.

### Step3 - Measurement of human visual attention

Evaluation of human visual changes based on UNISAL network (<a href="https://github.com/rdroste/unisal">link</a>) and a self-developed human labelling program.
