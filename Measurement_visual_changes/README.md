# A Saliency-Guided Street View Image Inpainting Framework for Efficient Last-Meters Wayfinding [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06934.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com">Paper</a>]

Self-developed program for human last-meters wayfinding evaluation. Paired images, for example, examples in (a) and (b), are used to report results for comparison, while unpaired images, e.g., examples in (c) and (d), are shown to each volunteer to ensure that the finding scene is not repeated.

### Step3 - Measurement of human visual attention

Evaluation of human visual changes based on UNISAL network (<a href="https://github.com/rdroste/unisal">link</a>) and a self-developed human labelling program.
