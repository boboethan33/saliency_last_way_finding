# A Saliency-Guided Street View Image Inpainting Framework for Efficient Last-Meters Wayfinding [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06934.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com">Paper</a>]

We propose a saliency-guided street view image inpainting method, which can remove distracting objects to redirect human visual attention to static landmarks.

## Summary 
Overview of the proposed saliency-guided street view image inpainting framework. It consists of three building blocks: hierarchical salient object selection, saliency-guided image inpainting based on fast Fourier convolutions (FFCs), and measurement of human visual attention by visual attention changes and a self-developed last-meters wayfinding testing platform. Note that modeling the interaction between saliency detection and image inpainting leads to effective removal of distracting objects for last-meters wayfinding.
